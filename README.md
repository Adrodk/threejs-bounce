# threejs-bounce

Hello!

In this project there are spheres bouncing, the ammount of spheres and their movements/size/color can be altered.



I plan on creating segments with different sized spheres and adding textures.



Could be used as an interactive website showing bouncing balls or particles, removing orbit controls when a camera angle is determined depending on the use.



They could also be mouse driven to add interactivity for the browsing user.



WIP
