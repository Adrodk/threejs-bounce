# threejs-bounce

Hello! 




In this project there are spheres bouncing, the amount of spheres and their movements/size/color can be altered.



I plan on adding textures.



The following gif is an example, it does not portray the correct gravity or movement of the spheres but gives the user a general idea from different angles, the spheres are bouncing on an invisible floor plane.
