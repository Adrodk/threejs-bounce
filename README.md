# threejs-bounce

Hello!

In this project there are spheres bouncing, the amount of spheres and their movements/size/color can be altered.



I plan on creating segments with different sized spheres and adding textures.



Could be used as an interactive website showing bouncing balls or particles, removing orbit controls when a camera angle is determined depending on the use.



They could also be mouse driven to add interactivity for the browsing user.


The following gif is an example, it does not portray the correct gravity or movement of the spheres but gives the user a general idea from different angles, the spheres are bouncing on an invisible floor plane.
